# DieRoller
This was a project from my Web 2 JavaScript class.  It simulates the roll of one or more six sided die.

This folder is a basic set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  There is basically no content in the HTML and CSS files.
The JavaScript file was an assignment in class to teach students how to use loops and functions in order to solve problems.
