DieRoller

This was a project from my Web 2 JavaScript class.  It simulates the roll of one or more six sided die.

This folder is a basic set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.  There is basically no content in the HTML file nor in the CSS file.

The JavaScript file was an assignment in class to teach students how to use loops and functions in order to solve problems 
and strengthen the foundation of our JavaScript skills.
