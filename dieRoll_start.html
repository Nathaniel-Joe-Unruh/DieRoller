<!-- If you look in the head of this file you will notice that the JS file is at the top instead of the bottom.
 Normally the link(s) to a JS file would be at the bottom to ensure that the page was loaded before running the JS script.
 However, in this situation the user would be prompted for information first, the program will run, and the page finishes loading after user interaction.
